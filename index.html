                        BMI (Body Mass Index) is a numerical value calculated based on a person's height and weight. It is commonly used as an indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight relative to their height.<br><br>The formula for calculating BMI is as follows:
                        weight (kg) / [height (m)]2 = BMI<br><br>
                        The resulting BMI value is then categorized into different ranges that generally correspond to different levels of weight and health:
                    <ul>
                       <li> Underweight: BMI below 18.5</li>
                       <li> Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9</li>
                       <li> Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9</li>
                       <li> Obesity (Class I): BMI between 30 and 34.9</li>
                       <li> Obesity (Class II): BMI between 35 and 39.9</li>
                       <li> Obesity (Class III): BMI of 40 or higher</li>
                    </ul>
                        It's important to note that while BMI provides a rough estimate of a person's body fatness, it does not directly measure body fat percentage or distribution.<br>Therefore, it may not be applicable to athletes, bodybuilders, or individuals with a significant amount of muscle mass, as muscle weighs more than fat.<br>Additionally, other factors such as age, gender, and overall health should be taken into consideration when assessing an individual's health status.<br>Consulting with a healthcare professional can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of one's weight and overall health.
